From Wikipedia:

Chessboard = 8x8
16 Pieces on a side: King, Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns
Rows are called "ranks", numbered 1 to 8
Columns are called "files", lettered A to H
Players: "black" vs "white", white always first
Checkmate = King under attack
Capture = Replacing opponent's piece
Valid move = Must not make king under attack
Stalemate = King is not under attack but no valid move is possible

Moves:
King: 1 square in any direction
Rook: Any number of square along rank or file, but not leap over other pieces
Bishop: Any number of square diagonally, but not leap over other pieces
Queen: Combines rook and bishop
Knight: To any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal; thus a L-shape (2 vertical + 1 horizontal or 2 horizontal + 1 vertical). May leap over other pieces
Pawn: Immediately in front of it (same file); or on its first move, two square in front; or capturing an opponent's piece diagonally in front of it

Special moves: Castling, En passant, Promotion
